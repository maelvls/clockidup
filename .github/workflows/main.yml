      # Only store binaries to Github Releases on tag. The release process looks
      # like this:
      #  1. Create and push a tag "0.5.0" either using git or using the GitHub
      #     Release UI.
      #  2. A draft GitHub Release is created. Since it is a draft, the
      #     subscribers to the clockidup GitHub Releases are not told that there
      #     is a new release yet.
      #  3. Add the release notes inside the description of the GitHub Release
      #     draft.
      #  4. Click "Publish". This time, subscribers receive a notification by
      #     email.
